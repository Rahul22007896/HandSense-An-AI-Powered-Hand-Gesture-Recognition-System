## HandSense-An-AI-Powered-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System
Real-time gesture recognition has emerged as a critical component for interactive applications, offering a novel means of human-computer interaction. This paper presents a system capable of real-time hand gesture recognition, facilitating various applications such as gaming, virtual reality, and smart home controls. The system is designed for rapid interpretation of gestures, ensuring high accuracy and responsiveness.
## About
Hand gesture recognition plays a pivotal role in advancing human-computer interaction (HCI), especially in environments where touchless control is desired. Real-time gesture recognition systems provide a dynamic way for users to control and interact with applications through natural hand movements. Such systems are essential for enhancing user experience in fields like virtual reality, smart home environments, and accessibility.
